# Version 0.2.0 (April 11, 2023)

## Breaking changes
- Removed support for iterating over index and value in
  [for loops]($scripting/#loops). This is now handled via unpacking and
  enumerating. Same goes for the [`map`]($array.map) method.
- [Dictionaries]($dictionary) now iterate in insertion order instead of
  alphabetical order.

## New features
- Added [unpacking syntax]($scripting/#bindings) for let bindings, which allows
  things like `{let (1, 2) = array}`
- Added [`enumerate`]($array.enumerate) method
